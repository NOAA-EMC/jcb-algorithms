# JCB Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains the algorithm YAML files for the JEDI Configuration Builder. These YAML files contain the high level configuration structure that is prescribed by the JEDI data assimilation system.

## Installation
This repo is typically installed with the main JEDI Configuration Builder (JCB) repository. It is a submodule of that system. Alternatively this repo may be cloned into another workflow repository. The default path used by JCB to search for algorithms can be overridden with another path.
